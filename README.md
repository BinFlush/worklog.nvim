# worklog.nvim

Small Neovim plugin for keeping a plain-text worklog.

The format is deliberately simple: write timestamped lines in a buffer, then
append derived blocks from the latest worklog.

## Input Format

A worklog line starts with a valid `HH:MM` time and may be followed by text.

```text
08:04 bake strudel
08:21 negotiate with goose
08:33 bake strudel
08:52 coffee with ghost #ooo
09:11 polish trombone
09:36 bake strudel
10:00 done
```

- each entry lasts until the next timestamped entry
- non-timestamped lines (such as this one) are ignored
- a line with only a valid time is allowed and is useful as a closing timestamp
- `#ooo` marks an entry as out of office
- out-of-office entries are included in `activity`, but excluded from `workday`
- identical items are grouped by text and `#ooo` state during summary
- the final line is usually a closing marker such as `done`, so the previous
  item has an end time, but the exact text does not matter.

## Active Worklog

Most commands operate on the active worklog.

- if the buffer contains one or more `--- worklog ---` headers, the latest one
  is the active worklog
- if there is no `--- worklog ---` header, the entire buffer is treated as the
  active worklog
- the active worklog ends at the next `--- ... ---` header, or at end of file

This makes it easy to keep raw notes at the top of the file and append derived
blocks below.

`WorklogCopy`, `WorklogSummarize`, and `WorklogQuantSum` use the active
worklog. `WorklogRepeat` instead uses the worklog body containing the cursor.

All commands except `WorklogOrder` stop if any worklog block in the buffer has
decreasing timestamps.

## Commands

### `:WorklogInsert`

Insert the current time into the worklog block containing the cursor.

Use this while logging live in a worklog.

- the cursor must be inside a worklog block
- the new entry is inserted in time order
- equal timestamps stay grouped together
- insert mode starts on the new line

### `:WorklogRepeat`

Repeat the activity under the cursor at the current time.

- the cursor line must be a valid worklog line
- the cursor must be inside a worklog block
- the new entry is inserted in time order
- equal timestamps stay grouped together
- any following summary or totals blocks are left in place

### `:WorklogCopy`

Append a new `--- worklog ---` block containing the active worklog unchanged.

Use this when you want to iteratively refine timestamps or descriptions by hand
while keeping the previous version above as a reference.

- copied items are normalized the same way as `:WorklogOrder`
- trailing empty lines attached to an item are removed in the copied block

### `:WorklogOrder`

Reorder every worklog block in the buffer by timestamp.

- timestamped lines are sorted in ascending time order
- equal timestamps are allowed and keep their original relative order
- non-timestamped lines after a timestamped line move with that line
- non-timestamped lines before the first timestamped line in a block stay at the top
- trailing empty lines attached to an item are removed

### `:WorklogSummarize`

Append an exact grouped summary for the active worklog.

- intervals are computed from the original timestamps
- repeated items are grouped together
- output is rendered in decimal hours
- `activity` includes all grouped items
- `workday` excludes grouped items marked `#ooo`

### `:WorklogQuantSum`

Append a grouped summary whose item durations are quantized to 15-minute blocks.

- intervals are still computed from the original timestamps
- identical items are grouped before quantization
- output is rendered in decimal hours
- `activity` is the sum of all quantized grouped items
- `workday` is the sum of quantized grouped items not marked `#ooo`

## Quantized Summary Rules

`WorklogQuantSum` uses this algorithm:

1. compute exact intervals from the raw timestamps
2. group identical items by text and `#ooo` state
3. round the total `activity` time to the nearest 15 minutes
4. round each grouped item down to a 15-minute block
5. distribute the remaining 15-minute blocks to the largest remainders

This keeps the quantized summary close to the exact total while making the
displayed grouped totals add up cleanly.

One important consequence:

- non-`#ooo` grouped rows will always sum exactly to `workday`
- all grouped rows, including `#ooo`, participate in the same quantization pass

## Ordering Rules

- timestamps within a worklog must not decrease
- equal timestamps are allowed
- if a command finds decreasing timestamps anywhere in the buffer, it stops and
  warns with the absolute line numbers of the first offending pair
- the warning suggests either fixing the lines manually or running
  `:WorklogOrder`

## Examples

### Example: exact grouped summary

Input worklog:

```text
08:04 bake strudel
08:21 negotiate with goose
08:33 bake strudel
08:52 coffee with ghost #ooo
09:11 polish trombone
09:36 bake strudel
10:00 done
```

`bake strudel` appears three times. The summary groups those intervals together and renders the result in decimal hours.

Exact summary:

```text
--- summary exact ---
1.00h bake strudel
0.20h negotiate with goose
0.32h coffee with ghost (ooo)
0.42h polish trombone

--- totals exact ---
1.93h activity
1.62h workday
```

Here:

- `activity` includes `coffee with ghost (ooo)`
- `workday` excludes it
- the row totals are exact, not rounded to 15-minute blocks

### Example: quantized grouped summary

Using the same input worklog `:WorklogQuantSum` appends:

```text
--- summary quantized ---
1.00h bake strudel
0.25h negotiate with goose
0.25h coffee with ghost (ooo)
0.50h polish trombone

--- totals quantized ---
2.00h activity
1.75h workday
```

Here:

- the exact `activity` total of `1.93h` is rounded to `2.00h`
- grouped items are rounded together, not one interval at a time
- the displayed grouped rows add up exactly to the displayed totals

### Example: copying a worklog block

Input buffer:

```text
08:04 bake strudel
08:21 negotiate with goose
08:33 bake strudel
10:00 done
```

After `:WorklogCopy`:

```text
08:04 bake strudel
08:21 negotiate with goose
08:33 bake strudel
10:00 done

--- worklog ---
08:04 bake strudel
08:21 negotiate with goose
08:33 bake strudel
10:00 done
```

The copied block becomes the latest `--- worklog ---` block, so later commands
that use the active worklog operate on that block rather than on the whole
buffer.

### Example: ordering a worklog block

Input buffer:

```text
08:30 bake strudel
note about apples
08:00 negotiate with goose
09:00 done
```

After `:WorklogOrder`:

```text
08:00 negotiate with goose
08:30 bake strudel
note about apples
09:00 done
```

The note moves with `08:30 bake strudel`, and trailing empty lines attached to
an item are removed.

### Example: active worklog selection

Input buffer:

```text
08:00 draft potion recipe
09:00 done

--- worklog ---
08:15 bake strudel
08:45 mail wizard council
09:00 done

--- summary quantized ---
0.50h bake strudel
0.25h mail wizard council

--- totals quantized ---
0.75h activity
0.75h workday
```

The active worklog is:

```text
08:15 bake strudel
08:45 mail wizard council
09:00 done
```

The older lines at the top and the appended summary are ignored for the next
operation.

## Suggested Workflow

One simple workflow is:

1. jot down raw timestamped lines during the day
2. At the end of the day, use `:WorklogCopy` to create a new editable worklog block, if need be
3. adjust timestamps and texts in the copied block if needed
4. run `:WorklogSummarize` for exact totals
5. run `:WorklogQuantSum` when you want grouped 15-minute reporting totals

This keeps the source log simple while making refinement and reporting cheap.

## Install

Install with your plugin manager of choice, then call
`require("worklog").setup()` to register the commands.

Example with `lazy.nvim`:

```lua
{
  "BinFlush/worklog.nvim",
  config = function()
    require("worklog").setup()
  end,
}
```

After the plugin is loaded, the `:WorklogInsert`, `:WorklogCopy`,
`:WorklogRepeat`, `:WorklogOrder`, `:WorklogSummarize`, and `:WorklogQuantSum`
commands are available in normal buffers.

## Example Keymaps

Example mappings:

```lua
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>wi", "<cmd>WorklogInsert<cr>", { desc = "Worklog insert time" })
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>wr", "<cmd>WorklogRepeat<cr>", { desc = "Worklog repeat activity" })
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>ww", "<cmd>WorklogCopy<cr>", { desc = "Worklog copy block" })
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>wo", "<cmd>WorklogOrder<cr>", { desc = "Worklog order blocks" })

vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>wq", "<cmd>WorklogQuantSum<cr>", { desc = "Worklog summarize quantized" })
```

## Development

Run the checked-in headless test suite with:

```sh
nvim --headless -i NONE -u NONE \
